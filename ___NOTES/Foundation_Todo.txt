Here are the things I feel a need to port/write a iteration of for a foundational setup for random shit, in probably this order.
Sub categories need to be done at a more precise time.
Also to note: don't add things that target content as we just need basic game shit done.

	. Browser Template: Either one of my old works, or /vg/stations.
		NEEDS: to have js crammed into it easily and nicely.
		--Browser Chat: Why not.

	. Runtime Viewer: /vg/station's
	. View Variable: /vg/station's, or my own.

	. Saycode: mine

	. MC: /vg/stations
		--Garbage SS.

	. Saving and Loading:
		NEEDS: to be simple enough so we will try json for the initial go
		NEEDS: to also be performant, so idk whether we should cram all their shit into one json file or multiple.
		Perhaps a folder for ckey and we just store the various things in there, like if we play a one-off modular game.

	. Maploader - /vg/stations or goons if they got one

	. Opening Menu:
		Prototype: just click a button and spawn in.
		NEEDS: to support both a whole sum(non ss13) and split part ss13 style icon setup for the char creation.
		NEEDS: saving and loading
	
	. Char Icon Assembly:
		IDEA 1: standard overlay hell
		IDEA 2: vis_contents altho we need to recolor all the shits so??

	. Onscreen UI shit - 
		NEEDS: Hotbars for skills/abilities
		NEEDS: simple stuff like cutscenes, displays etc.

	

	. Lighting: Either goonstation or /vg/station. Altho I did do a lighting system once a long time ago.
