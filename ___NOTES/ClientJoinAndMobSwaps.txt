Well I need to keep a note of my current idea of when a person joins at least until I solidify it enough.

ON PLAYER JOIN -------------------

Basically the following will occur.
/world/Isbanned() - Some dumb shit I don't plan on using
/client/New() START - New Client this gets called

/mob/Login() - WORLD produced a mob for them to be slammed into and it gets Login called, its the mob specified on world

Thus this should be
/mob/player_essence/Login() - We need somethin that don't move and do shit except look at a titlescreen and go thru menus.
	At this stage we will cram a spirit into the player_essence, and add it to the global list if they don't already got one. (EG IN THE OFFCHANCE THEY REJOIN THE TITLESCREEN)
	/datum/spirit = New() ere

/client/New() END - It finally returns.


ON PLAYER MOB SWAP ---------------
Im not sure which of these would fire first and I don't care right now

/mob/Logout()
	remove link to /datum/mind

/mob/Login()
	add link to /datum/mind of thing that crawled into us
